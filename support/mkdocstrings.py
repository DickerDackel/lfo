"""LFO - Low-Frequency-Oscillators for python

This class transfers the concept of LFOs from modylar synthesizers to python.

So what is an LFO?  LFO stands for "Low Frequency Oscillator".  It's a curve
that doesn't stop and that you can pull out values from.  The simplest form is
probably a sine wave.  Regardless of how often you travel along the circle,
you always get consistent and reproducible values out of it.

But LFOs come in many different shapes.  Here are the ones implemented right
now, but I'm open to suggestions to extend this list:

    * lfo.sine, lfo.cosine - A sine wave (and a cosine wave that I don't count extra)
    * lfo.triangle - A triangular wave
    * lfo.sawtooth - A sawtooth wave
    * lfo.square - A square wave
    * lfo.one - A wave that always outputs 1
    * lfo.zero - A wave that always outputs 0
    * lfo.random - A wave that outputs random values
    * lfo.inv_<waveform> - The inverse of all these

The lfo registers the start time of its instantiation.  If no period length -
the duration of one single wave - is provided, it defaults to 1 second.

Whenever you now query a value from the lfo, it gives you the proper
function result of that wave for this specific point in time.  Also, you can
query all of the wave forms from the same lfo.

Each waveform can be scaled and offset.  Note, that the inverted waves use the
same scale and offset as the normal ones, otherwise they would run out of
sync.

There's one important difference to the lfo you might know from your DAW or
synth.  Since most programmers will use these to ramp other values by
multiplication, this lfo is not centered around the 0 point of the y axis, but
all waves except sine and cosine variants are positioned so that they return a
value between 0 and 1. There are per-wave parameters to change this.

    'LFO':
"""The actual LFO class

The following settings can be passed to the init and during runtime as
attributes:

    period: float
        The duration of one full wave

    frequency: float
        The frequency of the LFO is `1 / period.

    cycles: int = 0
        Limit the number of cycles the LFO runs.

        If the number is reached, the LFO will constantly return the proper
        value for the `lfo.period` time.

        **NOTE**: That means that the random wave will continue, since it's
        value is not dependent of time.

        If the LFO us used as an iterator, ending the cycle will raise
        StopIteration.

        lfo.reset() will set the cycle counter back to 0.

These attributes are read-only:

    t: float
        The current time within the current wave

    normalized: float
        The current time within the current wave, normalized to 0-1

    cycle: int
        The number of waves this LFO has completed

    frozen: bool
        The frozen status of the LFO.  Same as `lfo.is_frozen()`.

Wave attributes:

    Every wave attribute `lfo.<wave>` also provides an inverted variant
    `lfo.<inv_wave>`. All wave attributes have their own attenuverter and
    offset, `lfo.<wave>_attenuverter` and `lfo.<wave>_offset`
    respectively.  While `lfo.<wave>` and `lfo.inv_<wave>` are read-only,
    the attenuverters and offsets can be set in the init and during
    runtime.

    Waves:

        Sine/Cosine:
            sine
            cosine
            inv_sine
            inv_cosine
            sine_attenuverter
            cosine_attenuverter
            sine_offset
            cosine_offset

        Triangle:

            triangle
            inv_triangle
            triangle_attenuverter
            triangle_offset

        Sawtooth:
            sawtooth
            inv_sawtooth
            sawtooth_attenuverter
            sawtooth_offset

        Square:
            The square wave has two additional control parameters.  The
            pulsewidth `pw` is the duration the square wave is up.

            The pw_offset sets the start of the up-phase.  pw_offset is
            normalized to 0-1, so it wont be necessary to update it every
            time the wave is attenuverted.

            square
            inv_square
            square_attenuverter
            square_offset
            pw
            pw_offset

        Zero/One:
            one
            zero
            inv_one
            inv_zero
            one_attenuverter
            zero_attenuverter
            one_offset
            zero_offset

        Random
            random
            inv_random
            random_attenuverter
            random_offset


Additional methods and features:

    LFO compares properly with int, float and bool objects.
    LFO can be used as an iterator and is iterable.

    Note: It will run infinitely if lfo.cycles is not set.

    if the LFO object is called as function, it will return the value of
    the sine wave.
